# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Refactor and fix all API issues in the multi-agent-mcp codebase by making small incremental changes, testing them, and continuing with improvements.

## Key Knowledge
- The project is a multi-agent system with an MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) system
- Main files: `_api.py` (core API functionality), `approver.py`, `configurator.py`, `shell_tools.py`
- The `_api.py` module handles unified LLM API calls for multiple providers (Google/Gemini, Groq, Cerebras, SambaNova)
- Environment variables needed: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`
- Uses provider failover, rate limit checking, and quota management
- Codebase uses Python dataclasses, type hints, and follows modular architecture
- The modules need PYTHONPATH to be set properly when importing from src directory

## Recent Actions
- **[COMPLETED]** Analyzed the current API files structure and identified issues
- **[COMPLETED]** Removed backup files (`_api.py~`, `approver.py~`)
- **[COMPLETED]** Improved type annotations and import statements in `_api.py`
- **[COMPLETED]** Refactored `_initialize_providers()` function to use a loop and helper function
- **[COMPLETED]** Improved error handling by extracting logic into helper functions
- **[COMPLETED]** Refactored Google API call into smaller, focused functions
- **[COMPLETED]** Split the `api_caller()` function into smaller functions for better maintainability
- **[COMPLETED]** All tests pass, including compilation, type checking with mypy, and functionality tests
- **[COMPLETED]** Verified that all modules import correctly with proper PYTHONPATH

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Explore and analyze the current API files to understand the structure
- [DONE] Identify specific API issues in _api.py and other related files
- [DONE] Plan the refactoring approach
- [DONE] Make small, incremental changes
- [DONE] Test the changes to ensure they work correctly
- [DONE] Continue with additional refactoring as needed
