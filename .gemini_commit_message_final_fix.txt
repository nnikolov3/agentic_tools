refactor(memory): ensure retrieval weights are correctly typed as float

Configuration values for memory retrieval weights, whether from global or per-agent settings, could potentially be loaded as strings. This could lead to downstream TypeError exceptions when these weights are used in calculations.

This change introduces an explicit `float()` cast within the `get_weight` helper function. This ensures that all weight values are correctly converted to floats at the point of configuration loading, making the system more robust against varied configuration sources.

Additionally, this commit includes formatting improvements for better readability in related memory management files.
