# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create an agentic readme_writer_tool that generates high-quality project documentation based on best practices, technical writing standards, source code analysis, and local information, while following the project's design principles and coding standards.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Built on FastMCP (Model Context Protocol) framework for connecting AI models with external systems
- **Architecture**: Multi-agent system with specialized agents (approver, readme_writer, architect, designer, etc.) that follow MCP protocols
- **Design Principles**: All agents must follow 16 core design principles including simplicity, explicit over implicit, single responsibility, error handling excellence, and test-driven correctness
- **File Structure**: Core components in `src/`, configuration in `conf/mcp.toml`, documentation in `docs/`, tests in `tests/`
- **Coding Standards**: Full type hints, mypy validation, consistent error handling with chaining, immutable data structures when possible
- **Configuration**: All agents configured via TOML files with model specifications, temperature settings, and provider preferences
- **Quality Enforcement**: All code must pass mypy, linters, and pytest with >80% coverage

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Implemented `readme_writer_tool` with proper integration into FastMCP framework
- [DONE] Enhanced `shell_tools.py` with `get_git_info` and `get_project_structure` functions to gather accurate project context
- [DONE] Fixed performance inefficiency by calling `get_git_info` only once and passing git info as a parameter
- [DONE] Generated accurate README.md file with correct GitHub URL and project-specific information
- [DONE] Created comprehensive AGENTS.md documentation for all available agents in the system
- [DONE] Updated DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_GUIDE.md to include the GATHER-READ-THINK-DRAFT-WRITE-CONFIRM-UPDATE systematic process
- [DONE] Created AGENTIC_TOOLS_BEST_PRACTICES.md documenting best practices for the agentic tools
- [DONE] All changes approved by the approver_tool and committed to the repository

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Implement readme_writer_tool with accurate project information gathering capabilities
- [DONE] Fix redundant subprocess calls in the tool's implementation
- [DONE] Generate accurate README with correct project URL and specific information
- [DONE] Create comprehensive documentation for all available agents
- [DONE] Add systematic process documentation to DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_GUIDE.md
- [DONE] Address approver_tool feedback and make necessary corrections
- [TODO] Continue enhancing agent capabilities based on project needs
- [TODO] Maintain consistency with design principles and coding standards across all agents
- [TODO] Expand test coverage and ensure all agents meet quality standards
