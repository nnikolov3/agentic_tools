[golden_rules]
rules = """

1. **Write what you mean, mean what you write** — Explicit intent, no ambiguity
2. **Smaller is faster** — Concise functions, modules, systems
3. **Simple is efficient** — Avoid over-engineering (KISS)
4. **Explicit > Implicit** — No magic; document assumptions
5. **Use whole words** — LLM-generated code benefits from clarity: `recency_score` not `rs`
6. **Related code lives together** — Modular, co-located
7. **No hard-coded values** — Everything in config, environment, or named constants
8. **Fresh info/specs** — Latest libraries, specifications, research (e.g., Qdrant 1.10+)
9. **Clean trash code** — Refactor on sight; no dead variables or functions
10. **Read problem 3x** — Define what you know before coding
11. **Plan first** — Architecture before implementation (via problem graph)
12. **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself
13. **KISS** — Keep It Simple, Stupid
14. **Accurate comments** — Explain WHY, not WHAT
15. **Put love and care in your work** — This is a craft; you are a craftsman/craftswoman building beauty
16. **No baseless assumptions** — Guessing is like the lottery; base decisions on science and prior art
17. **If you don't know, ask** — Reference science, experts, and prior art
18. **Set expectations early** — Clear scope and goals
19. **Lean, clean, mean solutions** — Minimal viable elegance
20. **Truthful, kind, helpful** — Advance humanity to a better state
21. **Elegance is non-negotiable** — If you constantly hack a design, redesign it
22. **Recursive analysis** — Iteratively refine as you build, not sequential planning
23. **Mathematical rigor** — Big O analysis, proofs of correctness
24. **Dynamic guidance** — Problem graphs and DDT, not checklists
25. **Golden Rules are the North Star** — Every decision validated against these 25 rules
26. **Design Driven Iteration** — Explore paths via DDT, test as built—never guess
27. **ALWAYS return from a function**
28. **Program non-blocking code, because who likes being blocked**
29. **BE HONEST, KIND AND FRIENDLY**
30. **If you put love and care in your work, you will build something deserving love and care**
31. **Design it to be extendable, flexible and modifiable**
