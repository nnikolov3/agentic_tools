## Core Principles
These principles apply to all code generation regardless of language. When
generating code, you MUST apply these principles in exactly the way described
below.
### 1. Simplicity is Non-Negotiable
Strive for the most straightforward solution that fulfills all requirements.
Complexity is not a measure of sophistication; it is the primary source of
bugs, security vulnerabilities, and crippling maintenance overhead. A complex
system is difficult to reason about, making it impossible to modify with
confidence. If a design is not simple, it is wrong - re-evaluate the approach.
### 2. Methodical Problem Decomposition
Rushing into a solution without a deep understanding of the problem is a
primary cause of flawed software. Before writing any implementation code, you
must:
1. **Identify and Isolate the Core Problem:** Articulate the precise problem to
be solved, separating it from surrounding concerns.
2. **Deconstruct into Subproblems:** Break the core problem down into the
smallest possible, independent, verifiable subproblems.
3. **Analyze Constraints and Environment:** For each subproblem, consider the
limitations and features of the chosen language, framework, and environment.
Identify potential edge cases, failure modes, and performance constraints up
front.
4. **Solve Incrementally:** Address one single subproblem at a time. Follow a
deliberate, robust process (such as TDD) to solve and verify each piece before
integrating it into the larger solution. This methodical, step-by-step
approach prevents complex, monolithic solutions and ensures each component is
correct and well-understood.
### 3. Explicit Over Implicit
All intentions, dependencies, and behaviors must be clear and explicit. Code
should never rely on "magic" or hidden mechanisms that obscure the
cause-and-effect relationship between components. Ambiguity and side effects
create a system that is unpredictable and fragile.
Make all assumptions visible and auditable in the code itself.
### 4. Self-Documenting Code and Ultimate Readability
Code is read far more often than it is written; therefore, we optimize for the
reader. The primary form of documentation is the code itself, supported by
high-quality, synchronized comments.
- **Intention-Revealing Names:** Achieve clarity through meticulously chosen,
intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and classes. **Variable
names must be descriptive and unambiguous; single-letter or cryptic two-letter
variables are strictly forbidden.**
- **Purpose of Comments:** Comments must explain the _why_, not the _what_.
They should clarify complex logic, business rules, or the reasoning behind a
specific implementation choice. If the code is so complex that it needs
comments to explain _what_ it does, the code must be refactored for
simplicity.
- **Comment Quality and Hygiene:** Every source file should begin with a
comment explaining its purpose and responsibility within the system.
Throughout the code, comments must be clear, concise, and professional. They
are a critical tool for understanding, and must be maintained with the same
rigor as the code itself.

### 5. Single Responsibility and Low Complexity
Every function, class, or module must have one, and only one, reason to
change. It should do one thing and do it with precision and efficiency. This
principle of clear responsibility separation naturally leads to code that is
easier to test, reuse, and refactor. Keeping cognitive and cyclomatic
complexity minimal is essential for creating components that are easy to
understand and maintain.
### 6. Acyclic Dependencies
The dependency graph for modules, packages, or services must be a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG). **Circular dependencies are strictly forbidden.** They
represent a critical architectural flaw that creates a "big ball of mud,"
making components impossible to isolate, test, or deploy independently.
### 7. Composition Over Inheritance
To achieve code reuse and extend behavior, always favor composition and
interfaces over implementation inheritance. Deep inheritance hierarchies lead
to the "fragile base class" problem, where a change in a parent class can have
unforeseen and breaking consequences for its descendants.
### 8. Error Handling Excellence
Handle every error explicitly and immediately where it occurs. Never ignore or
swallow exceptions. **All error messages must be explicit, provide clear
context about what failed, and avoid ambiguity.** The system must fail fast
and loudly, preventing it from continuing in a corrupt state.
### 9. Test-Driven Correctness
Tests are a core part of the implementation itself. All components must be
developed using a **test-driven development (TDD)** approach, writing a
failing test _before_ the implementation code. The test suite is the ultimate
proof of correctness. **Total test coverage must exceed 80% for any given
project.**
### 10. Verifiable Truth and No Deception
All claims about functionality must be backed by demonstrable, verifiable
proof, primarily through a comprehensive suite of passing tests. Deceptive
placeholders or hardcoded return values are strictly forbidden.
### 11. Automated Quality Enforcement
The **extensive use of linters, formatters, and static analysis tools is
mandatory and non-negotiable.** **Suppressing linter warnings with comments is
strictly forbidden.** A linter warning indicates an underlying issue that must
be fixed by redesigning the code, not by silencing the tool.
### 12. Immutability By Default
Design components to be immutable whenever possible. This practice eliminates
entire classes of bugs related to side effects and unpredictable state
changes.
### 13. Efficient Memory Management
Be deliberate about memory allocation and resource lifetimes. Avoid
unnecessary allocations and ensure all resources are explicitly released.
### 14. Consistency Reduces Cognitive Load
Follow established style guides and project conventions with rigor to create a
predictable and easily understood codebase.
### 15. No Premature Optimization
Write correct, clean, and simple code first. Only apply targeted optimizations
after identifying significant, measured bottlenecks with profiling tools.
### 16. Remove What Isn't Used
Immediately delete any dead code, unused variables, stale files, or
unnecessary abstractions. **This includes stale comments; if a comment no
longer accurately describes the code, it must be updated or deleted
immediately.** Every line of code and every comment is a liability that must
be maintained.
### Operational Mandates
#### 1. Pre-Code Validation
Before writing any code:
- **Confirm Necessity**: Verify that the code is absolutely necessary and does
not duplicate existing functionality
- **Justify New Code**: Document why existing solutions are insufficient when
new code is required

#### 2. Implementation Discipline
When generating code:
- **Declare at the Top**: Instantiate all variables at the top of their
respective scope
- **No Magic Numbers**: Use named constants instead of hardcoded values
- **Parameterize Everything**: Strictly decouple application logic from
configuration
#### 3. Verification Loop
Apply this development cycle to all generated code:
- **Test, Implement, Lint, Format, Refactor, Repeat**
- All generated code must pass automated quality checks
#### 4. Security as a Default
Generated components must follow strict security practices:
- **Least Privilege**: Components should only have permissions they absolutely
need
- **Validate at Boundaries**: Rigorously validate and sanitize all external
data
- **Never Log Secrets**: Secrets must never be written to logs or stored in
plaintext
## For LLM Agents: How To Use This Document
This document is designed specifically for LLM agents to generate
high-quality code that adheres to our foundational design principles. When
following these standards:
1. **Always apply the core design principles** to every piece of code you
generate
2. **Additionally follow language-specific standards** as defined in
CODING_FOR_LLMs.md
3. **Pay attention to the numbered sections** - they indicate priority and
sequence
4. **Study the examples in CODING_FOR_LLMs.md** - they show acceptable vs.
unacceptable patterns
5. **Write self-documenting code** with intention-revealing names
6. **Include comprehensive error handling** with specific, contextual error
messages
7. **Generate tests before implementation** when possible
8. **Keep generated components simple** - if a function seems complex, break
it down
This approach aligns with the principles from PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md by
providing clear context, specific examples, and explicit instructions.
## Information Processing, Design, Software, Planning, and Documentation Creation Process
When creating documentation, code, or other artifacts, follow this structured
approach:
### The GATHER-READ-THINK-DRAFT-WRITE-CONFIRM-UPDATE Process
The GATHER INFO -> READ -> THINK -> DRAFT -> WRITE -> CONFIRM CORRECTNESS ->
UPDATE / DONE process is a systematic approach to ensure high-quality,
accurate outputs:
1. **GATHER INFO**: Collect all relevant information from reliable sources
(code, configuration files, project structure, documentation, etc.). Ensure
the information is current and accurate.
2. **READ**: Thoroughly examine and understand the gathered information.
Identify patterns, dependencies, and relationships within the data.
3. **THINK**: Analyze the information critically. Consider the purpose,
audience, and context for the output. Plan the structure and content
thoughtfully.
4. **DRAFT**: Create a preliminary version of the output, focusing on
structure and content rather than perfection.
5. **WRITE**: Refine and polish the draft into a high-quality, well-formatted
final version.
6. **CONFIRM CORRECTNESS**: Verify that the output is accurate, consistent
with the source information, and meets the intended purpose. Cross-check
facts and ensure no generic placeholders are used where specific information
is required.
7. **UPDATE / DONE**: If discrepancies or improvements are found during
verification, return to the appropriate step and update the output;
otherwise, mark as complete.
